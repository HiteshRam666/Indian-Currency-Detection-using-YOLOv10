## Overview ðŸ“‹

This project focuses on detecting and counting Indian currency notes using the YOLOv10n model, which is known for its efficiency in object detection tasks. The model is trained to recognize different denominations of Indian currency and can be deployed in various applications where automatic currency recognition is required.

## Features âœ¨
- **Real-time Currency Detection**: Detects and counts Indian currency notes in real-time.
- **Accurate Denomination Recognition**: Capable of distinguishing between various denominations.
- **Optimized for Speed**: Uses the lightweight YOLOv10n model for faster processing.

## Installation ðŸ”§

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/indian-currency-counter.git
   cd indian-currency-counter
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the trained YOLOv10n model and place it in the `models/` directory.

## Usage ðŸš€

1. Prepare your images or video feed for currency detection.
